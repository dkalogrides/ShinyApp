Shiny App for Developing Data Products. 
This application creates a bubble plot showing the difference in test scores between white students and black students in the United States from 1992-2011. Each plot on the graph represents the test score gap in a particular state, grade, year and test subject. Users can switch between 4th and 8th grade results by using the grade button. The application also estimates the average annual within state change in the gap for each grade by predicting the gap as a function of year, test subject, and state fixed effects. Data come from the National Assessment of Educational Progress: http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/
